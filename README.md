This project implements diachronic linguistic analysis on the Anarchist Library corpus

In order to run this project, you need to download the anarchist library (12GB) from https://theanarchistlibrary.org/robots.txt using wget.

The diachronic_data_build notebook converts html files to txt files for NLP. Set the data_path variable in that notebook to the “library” inside of the “theanarchistlibrary.org” generated by the download.

The model_build notebook builds a Word2Vec model on the data. Use the commented out loop with the dummy_counter to test on a smaller set of documents (the full corpus takes a lot of compute!)

The diachronic_analysis notebook allows for comparisons and nearest neighbor checks over time for the corpus. If plotting relationships over time make sure to call decade_to_present and relation_over_time with the same decade. Any function that takes in a decade should receive input only ending in zeroes, e.g. 1960, 1880, not 1945.
